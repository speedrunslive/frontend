    <h1>Get Yourself Speedrunning: A Series of 3 Weekly Post-AGDQ Races</h1>
    <p>
      You wanted it, you've got it! Get Yourself Speedrunning returns immediately after AGDQ 2017, bringing you 3 HUGE races with live commentary coverage, as well as comprehensive tournaments to keep the action going throughout this spring. As always we've made sure to choose 3 games which we feel make excellent speedruns, and which we think will appeal to both existing speedrunners who want to branch out, and potential runners looking for a solid game idea to start out with. </p>
    <p>
      For those who can't join, we are going to be re-streaming some of the top runners of the game on our Twitch channel, featuring commentary by some of our favorite hosts in the community. Details on each race are as follows. Featured racers may change pending any last minute surprises.
