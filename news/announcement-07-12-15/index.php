The indie studio <a href="http://tinyBuild.com"><u>tinyBuild</u></a> is no stranger to the speedrunning community, donating a generous $20,000 to AGDQ 2015!<br> Recently, tinyBuild contacted us, inquiring if we were interested in hosting a race of the upcoming remake of their game No Time To Explain.
</p><p>
Not only does the game look like a blast, but tinyBuild will be supplying substantial prizes for the tournament:
<ul style="margin-left:25px">	
<li><b>1st prize</b> – Xbox One, Name in Credits (Steam Version Only), additional TB game keys</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
The goal will be any%.
</p>
 <p>
The race will be accompanied by a re-stream of some of the top racers, featuring the developers themselves on commentary! In addition, tinyBuild has offered to provide Steam keys to anyone who expresses interest in joining the race. Keys will become available when the game releases on July 17th.

<h2>Mystery Tournament 7</h2>
<p>
<i>
Registration starting August 7th<br>
Tournament begins September 5th
</i>
</p>
 <p>
The Mystery Tournament is one of our favorite events to host, and is always a popular one. The idea is that when you join the tournament, you submit a small set of games into a game pool. As people compete in 1v1 races, they pull a game from this pool. You never know what you might get, and that's what makes it perfect for veteran and novice speedrunners alike!
 </p><p>
More info and previous brackets available at the <a href="http://mystery.beatthega.me/index.htm"><u>Mystery Tournament website</u></a>.  Be sure to follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/SRLmystery"><u>SRL Mystery twitter</u></a> for announcements as registration approaches!

<h2>Speed Gaming League Finals</h2>
<p>
<i>
Throughout October - November<br>
</i>
<u><a href="http://twitch.tv/speedgaming">http://twitch.tv/speedgaming</a></u>
</p>
 <p>
The Speed Gaming League is a competition organized by feasel and mithical9, designed to test a player's ability to learn a game quickly under a strict time constraint. Four participants each get a week to practice a specific goal of a given game. After that week of preparation, the players race to see who can get the fastest completion time of the goal within 30 minutes. Also featured each week is a mystery game, where the players get a mere 1 hour to learn and compete in a specific goal.
 </p><p>
SGL has held over 50 matches since it began in 2013, and during that time has pinpointed some of the best players in the speedrunning community. This fall, these players as well as some new faces will be going head to head to determine a champion of the Speed Gaming League.
 <p>
You can find full details about SGL at <a href="http://speedgaming.tv"><u>http://speedgaming.tv</u></a> or follow SGL on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/SpeedGamingShow"><u>http://twitter.com/SpeedGamingShow</u></a>. 
More information on the tournament will be revealed there as it becomes available.
