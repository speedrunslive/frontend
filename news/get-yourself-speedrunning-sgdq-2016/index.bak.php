<h1>Get Yourself Speedrunning: A Series of 3 Weekly Post-SGDQ Races</h1>
<p>
You wanted it, you've got it! Get Yourself Speedrunning returns immediately after SGDQ 2016, bringing you 3 HUGE races with live commentary coverage, as well as comprehensive tournaments to keep the action going throughout this summer and fall. As always we've made sure to choose 3 games which we feel make excellent speedruns, and which we think will appeal to both existing speedrunners who want to branch out, and potential runners looking for a solid game idea to start out with. </p><p>
For those who can't join, we are going to be re-streaming some of the top runners of the game on our Twitch channel, featuring commentary by some of our favorite hosts in the community. Details on each race are as follows. Featured racers may change pending any last minute surprises.

<br>
<h2 id="contest">Diablo II CD-Key Contest</h2>
<p>
To help us welcome as many entrants as possible, <a href="http://twitter.com/Blizzard_Ent" target="_blank"><u>Blizzard</u></a> has graciously donated us with 25 CD-keys for Diablo 2 and its expansion! We will be holding Twitter raffles to release them, so please follow our <a href="http://twitter.com/speedrunslive" target="_blank"><u>Twitter</u></a> for your chance to win!
</p>
<p>
Please note: In order be eligible to win, you must have retweeted the tweet, be following our twitter, AND you must have a valid account on Twitch.tv with at least one VOD streamed. By winning a key you are expected to join the race, and so we will be checking that any winners meet this criteria.
</p>
<p>
	If you don't win a key but want to join the race, you can buy Diablo II and its expansion together for $20 from the <a href="https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/game/legacy-games" target="_blank"><u>Blizzard store</u></a>.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Tournaments</h2>
<p>
Like last time, we will be featuring a double elimination tournament for each game. These tournaments are open entry, meaning that people of all skill levels are free to join. The tournaments from last GYS were a huge success, capping out at 63 players! If you're thinking about it, give it a try! Registration and start dates will be announced shortly before SGDQ.
</p>
<p>
	And of course, keep your eyes peeled for Mystery Tournament 9 coming up soon! The idea of the event is that when a player signs up, he or she submits a small set of games into a large game pool. As entrants compete in 1v1 races, they pull a game from this pool. You never know what you might get, and that's what makes it perfect for veteran and novice speedrunners alike! Information on registering for MT9 will come shortly after SGDQ 2016. </p>
<p>
Thank you all for your continued support, we hope to see you join the community and Get Yourself Speedrunning!
